      <h1>How To Stop Bullying!</h1>
      <p> If someone is getting bullied, help them. You have the power to stand up for the ones being targeted and hurt:
        One way to stand up for the victim is show them they have meaning.
        if you don't to want to directly/physically stand up to the bully or tell a teacher you can always pull the victim to the side and take them out of the situation/ toxic area. Donâ€™t go along with the bully and the rest of his/her group, its
        okay to say stop. Say no to the bullies and befriend the bullied people.
